# BohoCalc

BohoCalc is designed for **financial easiness**, targeted toward a younger audience who want to budget their salary, manage spending, and plan for investments.  
It helps with **tracking daily to monthly expenses** while encouraging smart saving habits.  

As someone slowly becoming financially free in college, I see more and more people in their 20s wanting to budget and calculate costs. BohoCalc is designed for that â€” providing an **aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use, and AI-assisted** way to plan your life financially.
